Welcome to the PureScript community blog! In this first post, I'm going to walk through the basics of getting set up to use the PureScript compiler `psc`, and its interactive mode `psci`.

I'll start with the installation of the compiler, go through the basic commands of `psc` and `psci`, working towards a solution of problem 1 from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1).


#### Installing the Compiler

You'll need [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and to be [able to install global packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions#option-1-change-the-permission-to-npm-s-default-directory) to proceed.

The Purescript compiler (psc) can be installed with npm:

    npm install -g purescript

(It can also be installed from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/purescript), or by downloading the latest [binary bundle](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases) for your OS. If you do so, make sure the `psc` executable is on your `$PATH`.)


#### Setting up the Development Environment

PureScript's core libraries are configured to use the [Pulp](https://github.com/bodil/pulp) build tool, and packages are available in the [Bower registry](http://bower.io/search/?q=purescript-).

If you don't have Pulp and Bower installed, install them now:

    npm install -g pulp bower

Create a new project in an empty directory using `pulp init`:

    pulp init

Your directory should now contain the following files:

- `bower.json` - contains library dependency information
- `bower_components/` - a directory for installed dependencies
- `src/Main.purs` - Entry point module for your project
- `test/Main.purs` - An empty test suite

At this point, you should be able to build the project and run the tests:

    pulp build
    pulp test

You should see output similar to the following:

    * Building project in /Users/paf31/Documents/Code/purescript/pulp-test
    * Build successful. Running tests...
    You should add some tests.
    * Tests OK.

If everything was built successfully, and the tests ran without problems, then the last line should state "Tests OK".

#### Installing Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed using Bower:

    bower install purescript-lists --save

#### Working in PSCI

PSCi is the interactive mode of PureScript. It is useful for working with pure computations, and for testing ideas.

Open PSCi by typing `pulp psci` at the command line. Pulp will create a file in your directory called `.psci`, which contains instructions to PSCi to load your modules and dependencies. If you invoke the PSCi executable directly, you would need to load these files by hand.

     ____                 ____            _       _   
    |  _ \ _   _ _ __ ___/ ___|  ___ _ __(_)_ __ | |_ 
    | |_) | | | | '__/ _ \___ \ / __| '__| | '_ \| __|
    |  __/| |_| | | |  __/___) | (__| |  | | |_) | |_ 
    |_|    \__,_|_|  \___|____/ \___|_|  |_| .__/ \__|
                                           |_|        
    
    :? shows help
    >

As the introduction indicates, you can type `:?` to see a list of commands:

    The following commands are available:

    :?                        Show this help menu
    :quit                     Quit PSCi
    :reset                    Discard all imported modules and declared bindings
    :browse      <module>     See all functions in <module>
    :load        <file>       Load <file> for importing
    :foreign     <file>       Load foreign module <file>
    :type        <expr>       Show the type of <expr>
    :kind        <type>       Show the kind of <type>
    :show        import       Show all imported modules
    :show        loaded       Show all loaded modules

    Further information is available on the PureScript wiki:
    --> https://github.com/purescript/purescript/wiki/psci

We will use a selection of these commands during this tutorial.

Start by pressing the Tab key to use the autocompletion feature. You will see a collection of names of functions from the Prelude which are available to use.

To see the type of one of these values, use the `:type` command, followed by a space, followed by the name of the value:

    > :type Prelude.map
    forall a b f. (Prelude.Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    > :type Data.List.zip
    forall a b. Data.List.List a -> Data.List.List b -> Data.List.List (Data.Tuple.Tuple a b)

We will be using some of the functions from the `Prelude` and `Data.List` modules, so import those by using the `import` keyword:

    import Prelude
    import Data.List

Note that using `Tab` to autocomplete names can be a useful time-saving device in `psci`.

#### Solving Project Euler #1

The following problem is taken from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1):
 
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
>
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

We can solve this problem neatly using functions and function composition, directly in `psci`.

Let's start by listing all of the natural numbers below 1000 as a list. We can do this using the `range` function from `Data.List`:

    > range 0 999

You should see a list with 1000 elements printed to the command line.

This value can be given a name, using a `let` binding:

    > let ns = range 0 999

Now let's filter out all of those elements which do not meet the criterion. We can use the `filter` function from `Data.List`, by providing a predicate function as its first argument:

    > let multiples = filter (\n -> mod n 3 == 0 || mod n 5 == 0) ns

You can see the result by evaluating `multiples` if you like, or even check its type:

    > multiples
    Cons 0 (Cons 3 (Cons 5 (Cons 6 (Cons ...
    > :type multiples
    List Int

Now we need to find the sum of the `multiples` array, to complete the solution. We can use the `sum` function from the `Data.Foldable` module.

    > import Data.Foldable
    > sum multiples
    233168

When you have finished using PSCi, type `:quit` to quit:

    > :quit
    See ya!

#### Compiling a Solution

Now that we've seen how to use `psci` to reach the answer, let's move our solution into a source file, and compile it using `psc`.

Create a new text file `src/Euler.purs` and copy the following code:

```purescript
module Euler1 where

import Prelude

import Data.List (range, filter)
import Data.Foldable (sum)

ns = range 0 999

multiples = filter (\n -> mod n 3 == 0 || mod n 5 == 0) ns

answer = sum multiples
```

It is possible to load this file directly into PSCi and to continue working:

    pulp psci
    > Euler1.answer
    233168
    > :quit
    See ya!

Alternatively, we can use Pulp to compile our new module to Javascript:

    pulp build

This will compile each module present in `src/` into a separate file in the `output/` directory.

#### Writing a Test Suite

To test our code, we'll use the `purescript-assert` library:

    bower i purescript-assert --save

Modify the `test/Main.purs` file, and add the following code:

```purescript
module Test.Main where

import Prelude
import Euler1 (answer)
import Test.Assert (assert)

main = do
  assert (answer == 233168)
```

Our "test suite" is just a single assertion that the `answer` value equals the correct integer. In a real test suite, we might use the `Eff` monad to compose multiple tests in our `main` function.

Run the tests using `pulp test`, and you should hopefully see "Tests OK" in the last line.

#### Creating Executables

We can modify the `main` function in the `src/Main.purs` module to print our result to the console:

```purescript
module Main where

import Prelude
import Euler1
import Control.Monad.Eff.Console

main = do
  log ("The answer is " ++ show answer)
```

The `pulp run` command can be used to compile and run the `Main` module:

    > pulp run
    * Building project in /Users/paf31/Documents/Code/purescript/pulp-test
    * Build successful.
    The answer is 233168

#### Conclusion

That's all for this post. We've seen how to use enough of the basics of `psc` and PSCi to compile, execute and test simple PureScript programs. If you would like more information, the [PureScript documentation](http://docs.purescript.org) lists all of the options for both `psc` and `psci`.

Until next time...
